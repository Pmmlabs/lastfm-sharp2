lastfm-sharp2
=============
This project is modification of [lastfm-sharp](https://code.google.com/p/lastfm-sharp/), which ended in 2009. Deleted deprecated code and changed scrobbling method, so now scrobbling works!

lastfm-sharp is an open-source Last.fm .NET/Mono interface (dll assembly) for accessing the Last.fm
webservices including music scrobbling support. It was started as a C# incarnation of its older python sister [pylast](http://pylast.googlecode.com/), and It has now become a complete abstraction layer of the Last.fm API. 

To compile this lib you'll have to use MonoDevelop or Visual Studio.
